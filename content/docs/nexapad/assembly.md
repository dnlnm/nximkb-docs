* **1x Case Kit**
    * **1x Top**
    * **1x Bottom**
* **1x PCB**
    * **1x Rotary encoder**
    * **1x 4-Pin female header**
* **1x FR4 Plate**
* **1x OLED display module**
* **4x M3 screw**

> * The case and keycaps are 3D printed. Some imperfections are normal.

## Steps

### Preparation

First, we have to do a test on the PCB to make sure the PCB is working properly. Install the OLED module in the 4-pin female header, like the image below.

Now, It's ready to be connect to USB. Check if the OLED module and rotary encoder are working. For the keys, use a piece of wire or tweezers to verify it's working properly.

### Switches and Plates

Snap a switch into each corners first.

Carefully snap the switches to the sockets. Be careful so you don't bend the contacts.

Then, add all the remaining switches. Double check the bottom and you should see all the contacts in the sockets.

  Don't push the switches too hard, or it will damage the hotswap socket pad on the PCB.

### Top case

First, remove the OLED module from PCB, if you follow the [preparation](#preparation) steps. Insert the module into the slot on the top case like below.

Lay down the top case on flat face. Then
